## Summary

_Firms with superior productivity, labeled superstar firms, are argued to be the link between rising concentration and the fall of the 
aggregate labor share in the US. This analysis confirms that similar evidence is found within the European context: the market share 
and firm size increase, whereas the labor share decreases with productivity. One of the much discussed mechanisms behind this  development is the spreading of fixed overhead labor costs: Highly productive firms gain market share, and can simultaneously spread 
fixed overhead labor costs over more output, thereby reducing their own labor share and the aggregated labor share of the industry. We show that this mechanism can be tested empirically. However, using German firm-level data, we do not find any empirical evidence of it. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing debate by removing one of the proposed mechanisms from the list of potential explanations for the rise of superstar firms._

## Methods and data

### Firm-level data

The study uses the IAB Establishment Panel, waves 1993-2017. DOI: 10.5164/IAB.IABBP9317.de.en.v1. The data set is

- an annual survey of 160,000 establishments covering the whole German economy
- conducted by the Federal Employment Agency
- representative at industry-group and federal state levels.

Data access was provided via remote data execution.

### Methods

We apply different statistical methods including 

- descriptive analyses
- panel data econometrics (GMM, structural estimation)
- regression techniques
- bootstrap.
