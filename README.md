# Testing the superstar firm hypothesis

author: Alexander Schiersch (DIW Berlin), Caroline Stiel (DIW Berlin)

_Firms with superior productivity, labeled superstar firms, are argued to be the link between rising concentration and the fall of the 
aggregate labor share in the US. This analysis confirms that similar evidence is found within the European context: the market share 
and firm size increase, whereas the labor share decreases with productivity. One of the much discussed mechanisms behind this  development is the spreading of fixed overhead labor costs: Highly productive firms gain market share, and can simultaneously spread 
fixed overhead labor costs over more output, thereby reducing their own labor share and the aggregated labor share of the industry. We show that this mechanism can be tested empirically. However, using German firm-level data, we do not find any empirical evidence of it. Our analysis contributes to the ongoing debate by removing one of the proposed mechanisms from the list of potential explanations for the rise of superstar firms._

The empirical analysis was done in `STATA`. In this repository you find all statistical programs necessary to conduct the analyses in the article. The study uses the IAB Establishment Panel, Waves 1993-2017. DOI: 10.5164/IAB.IABBP9317.de.en.v1. Data access was 
provided via remote data execution (project number at IAB: fdz1243).

The research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research while we were investigators in the research project "On the Innovativeness of Micro, Small, and Medium Sized Enterprises in Greece and Germany (INNOMSME)" (2018-2021) at DIW Berlin.
